                <h1>Sum of two Arrays</h1>
                <p>Hey coder ! We are here to help you and be your coding buddy. Let’s go through the step by step explanation of this question together. This is going to be one hell of a ride!</p>

                <h2>Problem Discussion:</h2>
                <p>Let us guide you through the given problem.</p>
                <p>You are given 2 numbers in the form of arrays.</p>
                <p>Now we know what mischief must be cooking in your mind. No, converting arrays into numbers and adding them is not possible as the length of arrays can be very lengthy.</p>
                <p>Reader, suppose we are given the following input : 31075 and 111111 , then notice the places of the digits when adding :</p>
                <img src="./fig1.png" alt="">
                <p>We also suggest you watch the question video to understand it better.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h2>Approach:</h2>
                <p>For the explanation we take the two numbers as 93468 and 1988 .We declare a new array (say sum[ ]) whose length is the larger of the two input array lengths.
                </p>
                <img src="./fig2.png" alt="">
                <p>We put pointers i ,j and k and the last place of all the arrays.</p>
                <p>In the first iteration, we add the values at i and j and store (i + j) %10 in k. Then we take (i + j) / 10 in carry (denoted by ‘c’) and decrease i , j and k by one place for all the subsequent iterations as follows:</p>
                <img src="./fig3.png" alt="">
                <p>When j pointer reaches -1 position , we add only value at i and value of carry and store it in the kth position of the sum array.</p>
                <p>Now reader, in case the carry at last position of i (i.e at 9) was 1 , then the sum would have been 10. So, in such a case we print ‘1’ by itself, store ‘0’ at kth position and then print the entire sum array.</p>
                <p>We highly recommend you to refer to Youtube video Sum of two arrays[0:46- 3:19] for detailed explanation .</p>

                        This time complexity is linear because for and while loops are used.

                    <p>
                        Initial value of carry is kept 0 and it changes in each iteration.

                        We iterate this code for k>=0 so that all positions of sum[ ] are filled.

                <li>

                    <p>
                        Reader, here, ‘d ‘ denotes the digit which is to be placed at kth position in sum[ ]. We initialize it with the value stored in carry.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <span>04</span>

                    <p>
                        If i is at a non-negative position (i.e some part of the number is still left to be added) then the value at i is added to the previous value of ‘d’.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>05</span>


                    <p>
                        Similarly, if j is non-negative then the value of j is also added to the previous value of ‘d’.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <p>
                        As discussed previously , carry is updated as carry=d/10 and stores the ten’s place value of ‘d’ .
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>07</span>

                    <p>
                        Also the digit, ‘d’ is updated to d=d%10 to store the one’s place value of ‘d’.
                    </p>

                <li>

                    <p>
                        You need to store ‘d’ in the kth position of the sum[ ] array now.
